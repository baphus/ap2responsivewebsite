                    <p>Last year’s intramurals at Cebu Technological University was more than just the usual sports events and cheering squads — for me, it was about finally getting to perform live as a guitarist. And let me tell you… it was awesome.</p>
                    
                    <p>There’s something magical about being on stage, guitar in hand, music echoing through the crowd. It wasn’t just about playing notes — it was about the energy, the crowd reactions, and the connection with the people I was playing with. We weren’t just students anymore; we were performers, and for that moment, it felt like the whole campus was vibing with us.</p>
                    
                    <h3>Meeting the Band, Catching the Vibe</h3>
                    <p>One of the highlights? Meeting our drummer. Total stranger at first, but after a few jam sessions, we just clicked. It’s rare to find someone you can musically sync with so naturally, and jamming with them made every practice session something I actually looked forward to.</p>

                    <p> We all got a say in what songs to play, and I had a blast suggesting tracks that would get the crowd hyped. Practicing together, refining the flow, tightening transitions — it wasn’t always perfect, but it was always fun.</p>
                                
                    <h3>The Performance</h3>
                    <p>When we finally got on stage during the intrams, all the nerves melted away. The adrenaline, the cheers, the rhythm — it was pure joy. Seeing people react, sing along, and enjoy the set made every practice hour worth it. </p>    
                    
                    <p>Honestly, it feels like the browser that’s quietly doing everything right without screaming for attention.</p>

                    <h3>Already Looking Forward to the Next One</h3>
                    <p> That experience reminded me of why I love music in the first place. It connects people. It creates moments. And it makes you feel alive. I honestly hope I get the chance to do it again — maybe even with the same group (shoutout to our drummer!).</p>

                    <p> Until then, I’ll keep jamming, keep practicing, and keep waiting for that next opportunity to share the stage and the music again.</p>
